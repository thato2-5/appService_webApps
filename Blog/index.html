              <p>Beware Latest Telegram Scam</p>
              <hr>
              <p>The Financial Sector Conduct Authority <a href="#">FSCA</a> has warned the public to be vigilant of a scam being run on Telegram, in which individuals are impersonating Freedom Capital Investment Managers and Victoria Leigh Cook.
              <br>
              According to the information received by the FSCA, these individuals claim to offer investment opportuinities in cryptocurrency trading, forex trading and gold mining, promising substantial profits. There are three supported trading plans:
              <ol>
                <li>Beginners Plan</li>
                <li>Premium Plan</li>
                <li>VIP plan</li>
              </ol>
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>Investors can earn eight times their initial capital within six days.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The FSCA has learnt that the scam operates by requiring clients to select a trading plan, purchase bitcoins to fund a trading account and deposit funds using a provided adress.
              <br>The scammers then trade on behalf of the clients for a 10% commission on the total profit.

              <p class="blog-post-meta">July 21, 2024 by <a href="#">Former Educators</a></p>
              <h3>Understand the real implications of the new taxation on withdrawals</h3>
              <p>Ahead of the implementation of the two-pot retirement system in September, many retirement fund members are surprised to discover that they will pay tax on the withdrawal of funds from the savings pot.
              <br>Many are planning on withdrawing the once-off seeding capital that will be transferred from their vested (existing) funds to the savings pot.
              </p>
              <p>The SA Revenue Service (SARS) expects to collect about R5 billion in additional tax revenue this financial year from individuals who opt to withdraw this seeding capital.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>The higher the income one earns, the higher the tax paid.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>For example, a member withdrawing R30 000, who has a marginal tax rate of 41%, may pay about R13 500 in tax, leaving a net pay of R16 500.
              <br>
              Less attention has been paid to the longer-term consequences of changing the tax regime on withdrawals, especially when members resign.

              <p class="blog-post-meta">July 28, 2024 by <a href="#">Community Leaders</a></p>
              <h3>The money was meant to uplift poor communities but was stolen and used to buy a farm and luxury cars, with millions more unaccounted for</h3>
              <p>A farm, a Nissan Navara and other luxury cars were bought with funds meant to uplift poor communities. Millions more rands remain unaccountesd for.
              <br>
                This is according to a forensic report into the affairs of the National Skills Fund (NSF) of the department of higher education and training, which has shed some light on how money intended to assist the poor ended up in the pockets of a few. Investigators found evidence of fraud, forgery and nondelivery of services by companies, even though they had been paid.
              <br>
                Instaed, the beneficiaries bought luxury cars and embezzled funds, with one service provider buying a farm, while the community corporations which had expected to benefit from the aid suffered.

              <p class="mb-0">KnowRoaming has reinvented itself through a travel eSIM offering, though some of you may remember it as a comapny that offered a sticker that went over your SIM card to access data when travelling. Its new eSIM offering means consumers are spoilt for choice when itcomes to accessing data abroad.
              <br>
              Much like other providers, they cover over 200 regions, and it supports both Android and iOS on selected handsets with eSIM fuctionality. You can purchase eSIM packages by regions or individual countries, based on validity or data needed, and top them up when you run out. Pricing starts at $4.50 for 1GB of data valid for 7 days, and can go up to 10, 15, or 30 days with bigger bundles. There's also a global eSIM package for the frequent traveller, which covers 79 countries, or Europe for 39 countries, and a Middle East and North Africa package for 7 regions.
              <br>
